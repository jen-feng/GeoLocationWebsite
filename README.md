Using ajax to update the review table, works with uploading images

### Explanation
For the Geolocation getting the user's permission, if you are using regular mode, the website only asks the permission once and it will remember the choice. We have to maunually change the permission after that. But if using incognito mode will be fine. To test out the website better, please clear the cache and/or cookies in case the previous version is cached previously in your computer.
